# FAQ Chatbot

A simple FAQ chatbot built in Python that answers user questions by finding the most similar FAQ from a dataset. It uses **NLP preprocessing** with NLTK and SpaCy, and **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity** to match questions. A simple **Gradio web interface** allows users to interact with the chatbot.
